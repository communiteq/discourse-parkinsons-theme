                <p>Welcome to the Parkinson’s UK forum! If you're new to the forum, take a few minutes to discover the support our online
                community can offer for people living with or affected by Parkinson's.
                Our online forum is a space for you to chat to people who know what you're going through.
                Whether you have been newly diagnosed with Parkinson’s, are a carer or have been living with
                the condition for longer, the forum is a place for you chat about the things that are important to you…
                and sometimes share a virtual cup of tea. We hope you enjoy using the forum.</p>
